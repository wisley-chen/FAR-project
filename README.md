# FAR-project Description

One major complication of a spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis is the consequential lack of ability to maintain a healthy body temperature. 
Our design aims to reduce the risk of frostbite by notifying the disabled individual when their skin temperature is too low.

Our physical computing prototype contains a thermistor to collect temperature input data, an analog-to-digital converter, 
and a buzzer module to communicate output to the user. The python code functions to calculate an average skin temperature, 
and determine if the value falls in one of the 3 ranges.
